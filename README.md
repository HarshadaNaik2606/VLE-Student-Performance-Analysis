# Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyses the impact of Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) engagement on student performance using the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD).

## Objectives
- Examine whether VLE engagement improves student grades
- Predict student outcomes using machine learning
- Identify key factors influencing academic success

## Methods Used
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Hypothesis Testing (Welch’s t-test)
- Decision Tree Classification

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Key Findings
- Higher VLE engagement is strongly associated with better academic performance
- Decision Tree achieved ~85% prediction accuracy
- Engagement (sum_click) is the most important predictor
